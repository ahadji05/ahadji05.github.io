I am a computer hardware and software enthusiast interested in designing and 
developing efficient algorithms for single-core, or many-core systems. I am 
excited about programming languages that allow squeezing the computational 
resources of computers, such as C and C++, though I do love working with more 
high-level languages like Python. 

I am specializing in parallel processing and high-performance computing, so 
technologies like CUDA, MPI, and OpenMP are my tools to torturing the hell out of hardware \hj

I'm not only interested in performance; I give attention to portability, maintainability and testability.

My motto is: *Software design is an art, and writing low-overhead abstractions is a skill*
