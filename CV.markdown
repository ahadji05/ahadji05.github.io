Currently a Ph.D. candidate in **C**omputation B**a**sed **S**cience and **T**echn**o**logy **R**esearch **C**enter (CaSToRC) at the Cyprus Institute. I hold a B.Sc degree in Physics from the University of Cyprus (2018), and an M.Sc. in High-performance computing from the University of Edinburgh (2019).

My research is focused on the development of one-way wave propagation numerical solvers for seismic migration and inversion algorithms. Efficiency and portability on simple desktop computers up to heterogeneous supercomputers are two of the most important aspects of my effort. Day to day, I work with the programming languages C++ and Python, and in extend parallel programming APIs such as OpenMP, CUDA/HIP, and MPI.

My work is supported and supervised from faculty staff in the Cyprus Institute [CaSToRC](http://castorc.cyi.ac.cy/), and the Delft University of Technology [Delphi Consortium](https://delphi-consortium.com/).
