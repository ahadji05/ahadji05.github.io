## Work Experience
- #### Aramco Europe - R&D, *Sept. 2023 - present*
Working as a HPC software engineer for Aramco, involved in the research and development of technologies for geophysical seismic data-processing and imaging workflows, among others: 1) large-scale surface-related demultiple with GPU support, 2) near-surface characterization using surface waves, 3) optimization of a seismic data I/O modules using asynchrous CPU-GPU data transfers, 4) modeling of elastic wave-propagation.

- #### CERN Internship, *June 2018 - Aug. 2018*
Worked as a CERN intern during the summer of 2018 for approximately 10 weeks in a nuclear physics lab, and I was involved in the preparation of “Gamma NMR spectroscopy" experiment. Aside, I performed simulations for the experiment using MATLAB.

## Two great achievements
 - My team (me an 2 others) won the programming challenge ***"Fastest CPU code"*** in the International HPC summer school in Athens, June 2022!
 - Selected to participate in the CERN summer students program between 10th June -19th August 2018. This is a highly competitive program since usually 250-300 students are selected world-wide from a pool of 5000 applicants!

<!-- 
Currently a Ph.D. candidate in **C**omputation B**a**sed **S**cience and **T**echn**o**logy **R**esearch **C**enter (CaSToRC) at the Cyprus Institute. I hold a B.Sc degree in Physics from the University of Cyprus (2018), and an M.Sc. in High-performance computing from the University of Edinburgh (2019).

My research is focused on the development of one-way wave propagation numerical solvers for seismic migration and inversion algorithms. Efficiency and portability on simple desktop computers up to heterogeneous supercomputers are two of the most important aspects of my effort. Day to day, I work with the programming languages C++ and Python, and in extend parallel programming APIs such as OpenMP, CUDA/HIP, and MPI.

My work is supported and supervised from faculty staff in the Cyprus Institute [CaSToRC](http://castorc.cyi.ac.cy/), and the Delft University of Technology [Delphi Consortium](https://delphi-consortium.com/). -->
